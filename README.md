## Abstract

This project concentrates on the implementation of various analytical approaches, e.g. neural networks into storage and processing data for predictive maintenance. The mentioned study investigates solutions in the approach of machine learning techniques such as LSTM networks and distributed computing platform like Apache Spark to conclude that predictive maintenance models can be trusted and highly efficient in the forecasting of equipment failures. The main research conclusions are the universality of distributed computing architectures that make them ready for the processing of the whole set of sensor data and the possibility to use preventive maintenance systems created for industrial automation. This exercise is a move on that proves to be both informative and useful by providing data analytics capabilities in an industrial setting.

## I.	INTRODUCTION

## A.	Background and Motivation
Now, in the industrial sector, predictive maintenance is considered the main tool to increase productivity and to reduce downtime, and as a result to save the resource allocation costs. The traditional maintenance scheduling process is a combination of pre-determined coverages or unexpected repairs which result into inefficiency and higher costs. It is novel that new data analytics tools along with the rise of the spread of the sensor technologies enable enterprises to change to data-driven and predictive maintenance strategies.
The idea for the project was inspired by the general notion that preventive maintenance plays a great role in the industrial processâ€™s transformation. We are going to design a predictive maintenance system which will be able to anticipate equipment failures in advance helps to utilize the newest machine learning methods such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network among the others. On the other hand, this is a preventive approach that results in less unforeseen downtime and offers space to the businesses to tailor their maintenance schedule, as well as to improve operations, and extend the life of vital equipment.
Also, the integration of data analytics, big data storage and processing brings in newly emerged possibilities and problems. Industrial sensors are incredibly source to the data that is fast flowing and in the wide range of volumes, which raises the need for recording systems that are scalable and affordable and the analytics systems that can uncover the useful meanings from the huge data sets.
