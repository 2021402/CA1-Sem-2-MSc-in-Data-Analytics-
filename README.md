## Abstract

This project concentrates on the implementation of various analytical approaches, e.g. neural networks into storage and processing data for predictive maintenance. The mentioned study investigates solutions in the approach of machine learning techniques such as LSTM networks and distributed computing platform like Apache Spark to conclude that predictive maintenance models can be trusted and highly efficient in the forecasting of equipment failures. The main research conclusions are the universality of distributed computing architectures that make them ready for the processing of the whole set of sensor data and the possibility to use preventive maintenance systems created for industrial automation. This exercise is a move on that proves to be both informative and useful by providing data analytics capabilities in an industrial setting.
