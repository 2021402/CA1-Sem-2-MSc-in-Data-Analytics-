## Abstract

This project concentrates on the implementation of various analytical approaches, e.g. neural networks into storage and processing data for predictive maintenance. The mentioned study investigates solutions in the approach of machine learning techniques such as LSTM networks and distributed computing platform like Apache Spark to conclude that predictive maintenance models can be trusted and highly efficient in the forecasting of equipment failures. The main research conclusions are the universality of distributed computing architectures that make them ready for the processing of the whole set of sensor data and the possibility to use preventive maintenance systems created for industrial automation. This exercise is a move on that proves to be both informative and useful by providing data analytics capabilities in an industrial setting.

## I.	INTRODUCTION

## A.	Background and Motivation
Now, in the industrial sector, predictive maintenance is considered the main tool to increase productivity and to reduce downtime, and as a result to save the resource allocation costs. The traditional maintenance scheduling process is a combination of pre-determined coverages or unexpected repairs which result into inefficiency and higher costs. It is novel that new data analytics tools along with the rise of the spread of the sensor technologies enable enterprises to change to data-driven and predictive maintenance strategies.
The idea for the project was inspired by the general notion that preventive maintenance plays a great role in the industrial process’s transformation. We are going to design a predictive maintenance system which will be able to anticipate equipment failures in advance helps to utilize the newest machine learning methods such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network among the others. On the other hand, this is a preventive approach that results in less unforeseen downtime and offers space to the businesses to tailor their maintenance schedule, as well as to improve operations, and extend the life of vital equipment.
Also, the integration of data analytics, big data storage and processing brings in newly emerged possibilities and problems. Industrial sensors are incredibly source to the data that is fast flowing and in the wide range of volumes, which raises the need for recording systems that are scalable and affordable and the analytics systems that can uncover the useful meanings from the huge data sets.


## A.	Problem Statement

The traditional strategy is what most organizations use which involves exploring the equipment on a regular basis and reactively resolving on equipment faults. It usually ends up with the loose of a time, and inefficient use of resources, and moreover this leads to the decreasing in the operation output. The main issue here is that we cannot predict and thus avoid such accidents, resulting in unplanned downtimes and a consequent production loss.

**•	Unplanned Downtime:** The lack of predictive maintenance skills exposes industrial firms to unplanned downtime, which can have serious financial consequences and interrupt production plans.

**•	Suboptimal Resource Allocation:** Traditional maintenance approaches frequently result in suboptimal resource allocation, with maintenance operations occurring either too frequently, incurring needless expenses, or seldom, increasing the risk of failure.

**•	Reactive Maintenance:** Reactive solutions to equipment failures not only increase maintenance costs, but they also fail to address underlying issues, resulting in recurring failures and shorter equipment lifespans.

**•	Limited Data Utilization:** Despite the quantity of sensor data generated by industrial equipment, many businesses are unable to fully utilize this data for predictive maintenance owing to restrictions in data storage, processing, and analytics.

This project aims to overcome the stated problems by designing a maintenance prediction system that is built on LSTM networks, which fall under the category of RNN and that can process historical data from the sensors and foretell equipment failure. The first objective of the methodology is to wipe out downtime, facilitate resource sharing, and enhance operational reliability by foreseeing maintenance needs and setting up repairs before failures occur.
In addition, the program would be analyzing the consequences of managing large sensor Data in a Big Data storage and processing environment. The purpose is to deal with the scalability issue and to extract the critical information from massive databases which will contribute to the improvement of the more efficient monitoring models.

## C.	Research Question

**To help this initiative achieve its goals, the following research question is posed:**

"How can the LSTM networks be efficiently used to predict the manufacturing systems maintenance and what place do the Big Data storage and processing technologies have for this purpose?”

**This research question includes many major factors that will be investigated during the project:**

•	This project is designed to investigate which type of LSTM networks can be used for the prediction of equipment degradation and maintenance required by the historical sensor data. This includes assessing the trustworthiness, precision, and ability to scale in the actual circumstances where the LSTM-based preventive maintenance model is being deployed.

•	In this study, it is targeted to test the integration of predictive maintenance models based on LSTM with the big data storage and processing tech. This is done by identifying and resolving data sensory issues, storing, and retrieving data storage methods more effectively, and using advanced analytical tools to take insights from big data.

•	The research will be focusing on the practical/tangible effects of the application of predictive maintenance systems (based on LTSM) in the industrial sector. Such a system can be very complicated and difficult to implement, it will require to be deployed and synchronized with current maintenance, and the practice and procedures
